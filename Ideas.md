# Tonetribe Borrowing Ideas from Letterboxd
 - Letterboxd is a app where movie lovers can rate movies out of 5 and share their preferences
 - Advantages: 
 - We don't need to add the complicated implementation of adding all the songs (paying artists per listen)
 - We can attach links of playlists in spotify and apple music (leveraging pre-existing music platforms)

Letterbox motto: 
Track films you’ve watched.
Save those you want to see.
Tell your friends what’s good.  

Tonetribe motto:
Track your top ten favorite songs. 
Give your own ratings of albums and songs.
Tell your friends what’s good.  

 # Make Tonetribe a more intimate user experience with artists
 - Allow a feature to join communities around certain artists
 - Allow features to comment on songs alongside fans that enjoy the same music as yourself
 - Can access artist websites, concert information, and merch
