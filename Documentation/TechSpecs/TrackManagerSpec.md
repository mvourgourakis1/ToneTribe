# üéß TrackManager System - Technical Specification

## Overview

The TrackManager System is designed to manage a user's top songs by fetching data through an API and organizing it via song objects. The architecture consists of four main classes:

- `TrackManager`
- `Song`
- `APIFetcher`
- `Key` (legend only, not a functional class)

## üîÑ Class Relationships

- `APIFetcher` returns `Song[]` objects to `TrackManager`.
